        <h4>God Of Symbiot</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Knull</strong> is the god of symbiot.Born from the priomordial
          void that existed between the sixth and seventh cosmos. Knull claims
          dominion over the void and to be its avatar. As many symbiots as we
          have seen so far, such as Venom, Riot, Carnage, Toxin all of them are
          the shadow of Knull. The story of Knull starts form billon years back.
          Knull was existed even before the Big Bnag was created. Then the whole
          space was dark and empty. At that time Knull lived in the whole dark
          kingdom. He was the king of that kingdom. One day he saw some light of
          lights of creation. As soon as he removes the light he sees some gods.
          Those gods was none other than celestials whom we saw as villains in
          the movie Eternals.
