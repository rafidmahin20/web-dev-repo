        <strong>Knull</strong> is the god of symbiot.Born from the priomordial
        void that existed between the sixth and seventh cosmos. Knull claims
        dominion over the void and to be its avatar. As many symbiots as we have
        seen so far, such as Venom, Riot, Carnage, Toxin all of them are the
        shadow of Knull. The story of Knull starts form billon years back. Knull
        was existed even before the Big Bnag was created. Then the whole space
        was dark and empty. At that time Knull lived in the whole dark kingdom.
        He was the king of that kingdom. One day he saw some light of lights of
        creation. As soon as he removes the light he sees some gods. Those gods
        was none other than celestials whom we saw as villains in the movie
        Eternals. Anyway they came to start life in this dark kingdom or start a
        new universe. But Knull thinks they have come to occupy his kingdom.
